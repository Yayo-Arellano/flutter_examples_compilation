### Architecture (Flutter Bloc)

I decided to use Bloc and the architecture proposed in the [official webpage](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture) of the
flutter bloc package.

Using the bloc library allows us to separate our application into three layers:

- Presentation
- Business Logic
- Data
   - Repository
   - Data Provider
  
# Video and Blog (In spanish)
Also, I created an article in spanish in [my Blog](https://es.yayocode.com/2021/07/flutter-challenge-la-mejor-arquitectura.html)
